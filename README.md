# Laundry Management System

## 1. Methodology
In the laundry management system, there are three kinds of users, admin, employee
and student. The admin has access to the entire system whereas the employee and
student have limited access.

The students place thier laundry orders by filling up the details regarding the clothes submitted at thier respective dashboards.
Upon successfully placing the order, the order would be visible to the laundry employees at thier dashboard , so then after validating the order the employee can finally 
accept or reject the order.

For the collection of the laundry the students can schedule thier pickup according to the different available time slots.

## 2. Description
